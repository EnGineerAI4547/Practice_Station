# Practice Station

This repository is dedicated to my coding experiments and practice problems that may not fit into other repositories. This includes coding interview questions, small coding projects, and other miscellaneous practice problems.

## Daily Coding

I will aim to commit code daily, time permitting, to keep track of my progress.

## Repository Structure

The current directory contains various coding experiments and practice problems. It is organized into subdirectories based on language (e.g. "Python", "C#", "Java", etc.) and each language subdirectory will contain related contributions. The structure of the repository is as follows:

Practice_Station/  

├── Python/  

│ ├── search_questions.py  

│ ├── data_analysis.ipynb  

│ └── ...  

├── C#/  

│ ├── search_questions.cs  

│ ├── GUI_project.cs  

│ └── ...  

├── C/  

│ ├── search_questions.c  

│ ├── sorting_algorithms.c  

│ └── ...  

├── ...

## Languages

The languages that I intend to practice with and feature in this directory include but are not limited to Python, C#, C, C++, Java, Rust, HTML, CSS, JS, R, and potentially others.

Thank you for following along with my coding journey.
