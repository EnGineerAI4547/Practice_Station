Fine-Tuning Your Model
Having trained models, now you will learn how to evaluate them. 
In this chapter, you will be introduced to several metrics along with a visualization technique for analyzing classification model performance using scikit-learn. 
You will also learn how to optimize classification and regression models through the use of hyperparameter tuning.
