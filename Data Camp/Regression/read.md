In this chapter, you will be introduced to regression, and build models to predict sales values using a dataset on advertising expenditure. You will learn about the mechanics of linear regression and common performance metrics such as R-squared and root mean squared error. You will perform k-fold cross-validation, and apply regularization to regression models to reduce the risk of overfitting.
